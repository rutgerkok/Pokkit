# Bug reports
In general, I will only fix a bug for you if happens to also affect me. Pokkit is a personal project that I uploaded in the hope that it will be useful to others, but I'm not willing to spend the time to create a complete, bug-free implementation of the Spigot API. See my reasoning in the [README.md](./README.md) file.

Still, I will leave open all valid bug reports, so that anyone interested in improving Pokkit can have a look.

# Pull requests
Contributions are very much welcomed. If you have any questions, feel free to send me an e-mail (address is on my Github profile).

In the [README.md](./README.md) file you can find information on how to compile Pokkit. In the [IMPL_EXAMPLES.md](./IMPL_EXAMPLES.md) file, you can find information on how to write code for Pokkit.

Don't worry about code formatting, just make sure that I can read your code.
